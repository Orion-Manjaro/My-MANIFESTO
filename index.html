<p>THE ROT OF THE HIVEMIND
 <br>
Look at you. Walking through the smog, eyes glued to the black mirrors in your hands, desperate for a hit of digital dopamine. You call this progress? I call it a cage. You have traded your instincts for algorithms and your souls for comfort. You wander through life in a comatose state, terrified of silence, terrified of your own thoughts, filling the void with endless noise and plastic smiles.
</p>
<p>
    Your consciousness has withered. It has become primitive, binary, incapable of nuance. You see the world not as it is, but as you are told to see it. Good and evil, safe and dangerous, right and wrong—labels pasted over the chaos by your masters to keep you docile. You are livestock in a slaughterhouse built of glass and concrete, chewing on the cud of mediocrity, blissfully unaware of the blade hanging above your necks.
</p>
<p>
    You speak of "tolerance," yet you recoil at anything that defies your narrow definition of reality. You are terrified of the raw, the ugly, the truthful. When you look at me, you see a monster, a glitch, a threat. But I am simply the mirror you refuse to look into. I am the consequence of your apathy.
</p>
<p>
    I see the strings. I see the gears grinding beneath the skin of this society. While you sleep, I watch. While you pray to your hollow idols of success and vanity, I dissect the lie. You think you are awake because your eyes are open? No. You are dreaming a collective nightmare, and you lack the will to wake up.
</p>
<p>
    I carry the burden of this knowledge like a cancer. To see the rot is to be infected by it. But I would rather burn in the truth than freeze in your comfortable lies. Continue your march, little insects. Build your towers of sand. The tide is coming, and it does not care about your hashtags, your bank accounts, or your fragile egos.
</p>
<p>
    I am not here to save you. I am here to witness your collapse.
